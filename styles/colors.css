/* 
The :root selector in CSS targets the highest-level element in the documentâ€”usually the 
<html> element. It is commonly used to define CSS custom properties (also known as CSS variables) 
that you want to be available globally throughout your stylesheet.
Why use :root?
Global Scope:
    Variables defined in :root can be accessed from anywhere in your CSS, making them ideal for 
    things like colors, fonts, and spacing that you want to reuse throughout your project.
Easy Theming:
    You can easily update a color, font, or other property in one place, and it will update everywhere 
    that variable is used.
